Web app for taking notes during courses/labs

Goal

To develop a web app that allows students to take notes during courses/labs

Description

The application must allow students to organise their notes by classes they attend and individual study activities.

The platform is based on a Single Page Application architecture. It will be accessible on a desktop, mobile or tablet browser (depending on user preferences).

The note editor should be easy to use so that the student can take notes during the class. It will implement a markdown sistem to allow simple text formatting.

Minimal functionalities

As a student I want to be able to login with my institutional account (@stud.ase.ro) to manage my notes.

As a student I want to be able to view, add, edit and delete notes so that I can better organize information

As a student I want to be able to organize notes based on classes, date, labels (tags) and keywords so that I can retrieve information easily

As a student I want to be able to share notes with other colleagues

As a student I want to be able to integrate content from other sources and take notes (like for example while I listen to a youtube video, i read a book on kindle, attending an online conference)
